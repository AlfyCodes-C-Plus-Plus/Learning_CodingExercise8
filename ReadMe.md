# Coding Exercise 8

In this exercise you will write a program that uses arithmetic operators to manipulate an integer number that is provided to you.

You do NOT have to declare number, it is already declared and will be set to various values by the automated tester.

In order to complete this exercise you will have to update the value contained within the variable number by using hte currently contained value as an argument in the statement.

This can be done through the use of the assignment operator = in the following way:

E.g. number = number + 4

Lets assume that number is currently holding the value 3. This means that the above statement is equivalent to number = 3 + 4. Thereby, through the assignment operator, the new value of number will be 7.
